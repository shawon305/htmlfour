	<article class="right"><p> Although evidence of garment making has been around since 4000 B.C., sewing machines are a relatively new invention for man-kind. They have been around since the early 1800's. A gentleman by the name of Elias Howe filed the first patent for a functional sewing machine. However, he didn't do much with his new patent. It wasn't until 1850 when Isaac Singer designed and built a sewing machine that was both easy to use and functional for the well to do home sewist. Couple that with the novel idea of financing home appliances and the rest, as they say, is history. He began mass production and brought about a new era of sewing freedom for the modern homemaker.
