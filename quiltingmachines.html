	<p title="Never call a quilt a blanket around a quilter, he/she may throw a spool of thread at you"> A quilt is made up of three layers. The pieced quilt top, the soft batting layer, and the backing fabric layer. Quilters would have to pin all of the layers together. Once these layers were pinned, the quilter used a hoop to capture the center of the quilt sandwich together. She would sew all the layers together within the hoop's sewing area like the first photo below. Once done, she would undo the hoop and move to an adjcacent section. An accomplished quilter could finish quilting a full sized quilt in a few weeks by her self or in a day with friends. Some intricately designed quilts would take months to complete.</p>
	<p>Much later, many begin to use their home sewing machines to quilt. They would lower the feed dogs and move the quilt under the needle of a home sewing machine to bring the layers togther. That worked but it was still slow (not to mention a workout) because the quilter had to move the quilt under the needle.</p>
	<p>In the early 80's, Ken Gammell figured out a way to make the quilting process easier. He developed what we call a Long Arm Quilting Machine. This machine allowed the quilter to load the quilt sandwich onto rollers to be sewn by a larger-throat sewing machine much like the first photo below. This revolutioized quilting and made it much easier to complete quilts more quickly</p>
<h3>Types of Quilting Machines</h3>

  <li>Long Arm Quilter</li>
  <li>Mid-Arm/Sit Down Quilter</li>
  </ul>
<h4> Long Arm Quilting Machine</h4>
	<p> This machine, as mentioned previously, was designed to allow the quilter to move the machine, not the quilt. The long arm can be used free motion, with panographs or with software. Free motion quilting is accomplished when the quilter controls the machine, moving the machine head to create the quilting design on the quilt. They do this in much the same way an artist draws with a pencil. They can create custom beuatiful designs to fit the theme of the quilt they are making. This is highlighted int the second photo below.</p>
	<p> Pantograph quilting is continuous line quilting pattern designs on a paper roll or template designed for use on longarm quilting machines. A pantograph quilting patttern, or panto, is used by longarm machine quilters who move the head of their machine over the quilt. with the use of a laser or pin to trace the design onto the quilt.</p>
	<p>Automated Quilting is quilting with software can be fully automated. The quilter simply enters the information about the quilt and the desired design on a tablet. The tablet bascically controls the machine and quilts the selected pattern out onto the quilt. It is by far, the most advanced and worry free way to quilt as indicated by the final photo. Long Arm Quilting can be cost prohibitive to the home quilter. They range from $6000 for a basic quilter upwards of $35000 for the automated quilters</p>
	<h5> The Mid-Arm</h5>
	<p>Also known as a Sit-Down Sewing Machine is like a long arm in it's shape, but the quilter controls the quilt. This is advantagous over quilting on a domestic. There is much more space to move the quilt around. The Mid-Arm can be attached to a frame or to  a large work table. A stitch regulator can be installed to controll the speed and quality of the stitches. It is a much more budget friendly option. It costs anywhere between $4000 and $9000 msrp.</p>
